# Matrix-Factorization-for-Recommender-System

Problem Description and the intuition to solve the problem are given in the two pdf files respectively: "Matrix Factorization for Recommender System.pdf" and "L16_Matrix Factorization.pdf".


Special Instruction:
ratings_train.xlsx (uploaded)             : Ratings from 16,000 users for 100 products, a matrix with dimensions 16000 X 100
ratings_validate.xlsx (uploaded)          : Ratings from  4,000 users for 100 products, a matrix with dimensions  4000 X 100

1. Products are same in all three datafiles, but there are no overlapping users.
2. Ratings are real values ranging from 0.00 to 5.00 (the value "-1" corresponds to "null" = "not rated").
3. Each row represents a user.
